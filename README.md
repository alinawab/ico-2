# ico-2
A proposal to make ICOs less scammy

DAICO (Distributed Autonomous ICO)

Main idea: Improve ERC20 specification to allow for the following items
1) monthly disbursements of funds vs. at completion
2) voting for allocation of funds
3) mechanisms to nuke projects that are not performing (I'm thinking the user can leave)
